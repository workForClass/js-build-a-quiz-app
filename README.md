# JS Assessment

This code is unfinished. You will need to study it to figure out what it does. Then you will need to use this and your own code, to finish the app.

## Quiz Application

Complete the following tasks:

1. Add 2 more questions to the app (each question must have 4 options)

2. Calculate the score as the total of the number of correct answers

3. Add an Event listener for the submit button, which will display the score and highlight the correct answers when the button is clicked

4. Reload the page when the reset button is clicked (hint: search window.location)

5. Add a countdown timer - when the time is up, end the quiz, display the score and highlight the correct answers

The assessment must be completed by 3:30pm. When you have finished, upload your work to GitHub Pages and share the link with your pod instructor by DM on Slack.
